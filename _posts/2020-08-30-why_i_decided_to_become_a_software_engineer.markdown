Well, my love for technology all started back on July 16, 1993. The moment I was born, I knew that I was destined to be a software engineer. 

Haha, just kidding! If only life was that simple, right? I went from wanting to be a gymnastics coach, to nursing, and then eventually I settled with teaching. I am now coming on my third year as an elementary teacher, and as much as I wished it would've worked it, it just isn't compatible with me. People often say, "Oh, but you get so much time off!" but what's the point if the job doesn't make me happy?

Exactly! For the last year, I have been daydreaming about the possibility of being a software engineer. The biggest thing that has been pushing me back is the mindset of believing it may be too difficult for me. I always thought coding was interesting and thought it would be cool if I could one day learn to do that, but yet the villains in my head kept telling me to settle with my career and that even if I tried, it would be too hard to do. As you can see, I decided to go ahead and put those thoughts behind me. Before the Flatiron pre-bootcamp, I had never coded before but while doing the pre-bootcamp, I had fun debugging the labs and learning about the history of coding. After a few weeks, I knew that this was exactly where I wanted to be.

As a teacher, I've been telling my students for years that they are capable of doing whatever they set their mind to. It turns out that the saying is true as well for Ms. Grassi, who knew? I've always been considered "tech savvy" amongst my friends and family members, but I didn't think I could do anything like this. So now I am no longer gaming in my free time, I am coding. Oddly enough, I am satisfied with that because I am gradually making a career change that I believe is my calling.

Until next time!
